      <p>If you were vaccinated as part of an official clinical trial in England, you should have received a letter confirming this. The letter explains that your COVID-19 status is “fully vaccinated”.</p>
      <p>If you have not received a letter, contact your clinical trial site.</p>
      <p>You can also get an NHS COVID Pass showing your vaccination status for domestic events using the NHS App or the online NHS COVID Pass service. You’ll be able to get a digital COVID Pass for travel abroad soon.</p>


      <h3>COVID-19 status for children</h3>
      <p>The NHS COVID Pass is not available for children under the age of 18.</p>
      <p>If you're travelling abroad, your child may still need to show a negative test result. Check the entry requirements for the country you're visiting.</p>
      <p>Children under the age of 18 do not need to show a COVID Pass to get into venues in England.</p>

      </details>

      <h4>How long digital versions are valid for</h4>
        <p>If you've had:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a vaccine used in the UK – your pass lasts for 30 days, but the 30-day period refreshes every time you log in</li>
          <li>a negative PCR test or rapid lateral flow test – your pass is valid for 48 hours after a negative result</li>
          <li>a positive PCR test – your pass lasts 30 days, but the 30 day period refreshes every time you log in (for up to 180 days after you took the test)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you download your COVID Pass as a PDF, always check the expiry date before using it.</p>
        <p>If you're fully vaccinated or had a positive test result, the barcode on a PDF is valid for 30 days.</p>


      <h3>Get a paper version (vaccination status only)</h3>
      <p>You can get an NHS COVID Pass letter sent to you in the post.</p>
      <p>This shows you've been vaccinated against COVID-19. It does not show COVID-19 test results.</p>
      <p>You can ask for a letter after having your 2nd dose of the vaccine, or after a single-dose Janssen vaccine. You may need to wait 5 working days before using the service, so that your records will be up to date.</p>
      <p>You should get the letter within 5 working days.</p>
      <p>You can use your letter at venues in England where you need to prove your COVID-19 status 2 weeks after you have been fully vaccinated.</p>
      <p>You do not need to be registered with a GP surgery or have an NHS login for this.</p>

      <p>You can get a letter by:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><a href="/{{version}}/start">requesting a COVID Pass letter online</a></li>
      <li>calling 119 – do not call 119 if you're travelling in more than 4 weeks' time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is also known as a COVID-19 post vaccination letter. The paper version does not have an expiry date.</p>

      <h2>Protecting your data</h2>
      <p>When you access your NHS COVID Pass via the NHS App, or directly via the NHS website, you will use NHS login. NHS login has advanced security features to protect you and minimise any risk of fraud.</p>
      <p>Your COVID Pass only shows your vaccination record or test results, and no other personal health records.</p>
